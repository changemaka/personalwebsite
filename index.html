  		<h2>Thank you for visiting my website.</h2> 
  	<p>After completing my B.Sc. Computer Science, I decided to teach myself business by working with five different start-ups in my industries of interest. Doing that helped me to experience firsthand why start-ups fail and what it takes for a start-up to thrive. I found that the secret lies in the team. I have always wanted to start a software company. What better way to achieve that dream than to enroll at MEST and graduate with a team of co-founders who received the same quality of training as I did. 
  	I have research interests in sign language instruction, plastic waste recycling and assistive technology. I have a warm personality and a healthy sense of humour, enjoy writing and trying new things. I value Independence, Teamwork and Creativity. 
  	I am very focused and organized.
